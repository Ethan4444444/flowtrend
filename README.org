#+title: flowsmooth: automatic gating of flow cytometry data over time

This directory contains code that directly generates a software package called
`flowsmooth`, using [[https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project][litr]]. Each R
Markdown document in this directory -- called ~1description.Rmd~,
~2generate-data.Rmd~, and so forth -- contain code that directly builds the R
package. 

The resulting "knitted" documentation from these files is [[./_book/index.html][here]], and..

The resulting R package is in the subdirectory [[./flowsmooth]], and can be
installed as follows.

#+begin_src R
remotes::install_github("sangwon-hyun/flowsmooth", subdir = "flowsmooth")
#+end_src
