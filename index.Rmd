# Introduction

This package implements `flowtrend`, a model used for smooth estimation of
mixture models across time. The documentation and package are both created using
one simple command:

```{r render, eval = FALSE}
litr::render("index.Rmd", output_format = litr::litr_gitbook())
```


This line is purely for testing (to be deleted later!).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
litr::load_all("index.Rmd")##, output_format = litr::litr_gitbook())
```
